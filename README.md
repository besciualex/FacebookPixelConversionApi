# Simple FacebookPixelConversionApi Class

This class allows someone to quickly send Facebook Events for the new Pixel Conversion API. I uploaded it here so others could use it fast, without bothering to read documentation. Facebook API used at the moment of initial commit is v10 (stable on April 2021).

## Description

This class uses only three events from whole Facebook Event List as I only required those three. Feel free to expand it as you like.
* ViewContent - should be called on Landing pages or important pages
* Lead - should be used on LEAD conversion
* Contact - should be used on Contact page/scripts
