# Simple FacebookPixelConversionApi Class

This class allows someone to quickly send Facebook Events for the new Pixel Conversion API. I uploaded it here so others could use it fast, without bothering to read documentation.

## Description

This class uses only three events from whole Facebook Event List as I only required those three. Feel free to expand it as you like.
